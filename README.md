# Overview of the TA Application Functionality 

Added MVC/CRUD for Courses. Admin has access to notes on the courses that only they can see/edit. Professors and Admins can see the list of all Courses in the database. The Details page for any given Course is able to be viewed by any logged-in client.
Added Google authentication registration as an option (and it works!).

# Comments to Evaluators:

I could not for the life of me get the styles.css file thing to work with the nested css files and ended up just adding the stylesheet stuff at the start of the cshtml document.
