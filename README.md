# Overview of the TA Application Functionality 

Applicants can now create applications and submit them, which creates an entry in a database. Users or admins can edit or delete existing applications.
Changes to applications record time of change and user that made the change. Admins and professors have access to a list of applicants with relevant data
names in this list can be clicked to see more details about the specific applicant

ModificationTracking:
Modificant Tracking adds value by allowing easy tracking of who made which changes, this can help prevent malicious actors, as it is easy to see who made
changes to a entry. This also allows for sorting by new applications, or informing users how many new or changed applications there have been since the 
last time they logged in. These features are table agnostic and can be implemented in any DB table with relative ease, adding a lot of value for very 
little effort
